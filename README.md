# Cryptocurrency-Seed-Analyser

This application takes an input of a cryptocurrency wallet mnemonic seed and calculates the balances inside wallets associated with the entered seed.

The code that I have developed has been built on top of Iancoleman.io.

This project was developed as part of my university final year project for the south wales police.

Blockchain.js and index.html are the files developed by me
